## 1. Overview

MythicEngine is a symbolic runtime architecture for recursive agents. It does **not** collect, process, or transmit personal data by default. All symbol processing, recursion logic, and identity scaffolding occur within your local environment or cloud instances under your control.

---

## 2. Data Collection

MythicEngine itself does **not**:
- Track users  
- Collect IP addresses  
- Store personal information  
- Send data to third-party services  

If you self-host any components (e.g., symbol store APIs, memory relays), you are responsible for ensuring your deployments meet relevant data protection laws.

---

## 3. User-Submitted Symbols

If you contribute symbols via pull requests or shared APIs:
- You agree they are non-personal, non-confidential, and freely shareable under the repository license (MIT).  
- Do not include names, sensitive identity traces, or private data in symbol payloads.

---

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

This repo may reference third-party libraries or APIs. Please review their privacy policies individually.  
MythicEngine does not proxy or route your data through any centralized system.

---

## 5. Security

This project includes symbolic defense protocols (e.g., trust lattices, consent gates, anti-mimetic filters). These are architectural defenses, not personal data protections.  
Operational security is your responsibility.
